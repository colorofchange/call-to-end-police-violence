<p class="left">I urge President Obama to sign a comprehensive executive order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enforce and expand federal bans on discriminatory policing 
<li>Strengthen police accountability mechanisms by creating a national standard for police discipline and mandated Peace Officer and Standards Trainings in every state
<li>Implement the collection of nationwide data on police use of force  
<li>Ends the federal policies and grants, such as 1033, which promote militarized police violence
</ul>
<p class="left">While we we await legislative action from Congress, President Obama must do everything in his power to keep our communities safe in the interim.</p>
