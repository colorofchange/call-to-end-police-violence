<p class="left">I urge the representative to support an executive order that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expands and enforces federal bans on discriminatory policing 
<li>Strengthens police accountability mechanisms by creating a national police discipline matrix and mandated Peace Officer and Standards Trainings in every state 
<li>Implements the collection of nationwide data on police use of force  
<li>Ends the federal policies and grants, such as 1033, which promote militarized police violence
</ul>
<p class="left">While Congress takes action, we cannot afford to wait for President Obama to do everything in his power to keep our communities safe.</p>
