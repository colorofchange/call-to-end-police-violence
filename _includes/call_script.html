<p class="left">I urge you to call on President Obama to sign an executive order that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expands and enforces federal bans on discriminatory policing;
<li>Strengthens police accountability mechanisms by creating a national standard for police discipline and mandated Peace Officer and Standards Trainings in every state;
<li>Implements the collection of nationwide data on police use of force;
<li>Ends the federal policies and grants, such as 1033, which promote militarized police violence.
</ul>
<p class="left">While we we await legislative action from Congress, President Obama must do everything in his power to keep our communities safe in the interim.</p>
