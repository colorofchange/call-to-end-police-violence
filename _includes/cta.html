    <b>Ferguson is America. There is a crisis of violent, discriminatory police abuse targeting Black and brown communities and President Obama must be held accountable.</b> Recently, the Department of Justice (DOJ) failed to hold Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson accountable for tragically killing 18-year-old Michael Brown. And while the DOJ found the Ferguson Police Department guilty of widespread racism, it's not enough.
</p>

<p>In the past 4 weeks, at least 4 Black or brown people have been killed or harmed by police:
    <ul>
        <li>2/10/15 — Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35-years-old, fatally shot 12 times by Pasco police with his hands in the air
        <li>3/1/15 — Africa, a man living on Skid Row in Los Angeles was fatally shot at least 5 times by Los Angeles police
        <li>3/5/15 — Sergio Navas, unarmed, was fatally shot by Los Angeles police
        <li>3/6/15 – A police officer in Madison, Wisconsin, shot and killed 19 year old, unarmed Tony Robinson
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
	<b>Right now, President Obama is deciding which of the recommendations from the Task Force on 21st Century Policing will become law.</b> The latest recommendations include important reforms to increase police oversight and accountability, but don't go far enough to end police militarization or create a clear pathway of enforcement. We need implementation of the reforms and even greater executive action. <b>Will you call your representative today and urge them to publicly support a comprehensive executive order to enforce and expand the federal ban on discriminatory policing and strengthen police accountability nationwide?</b>
